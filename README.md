#NAME
sudoku - a golang sudoku solver

#SYNOPSIS
./sudoku [--verbose]|[--version]|[--format=9.|90|1.|10] < puzzle > solution

#DESCRIPTION
'sudoku' implements a heuristic-based command-line Sudoku solver.

The solver attempts to make progress using heuristics and only falls back
to a brute force (or backtracking) approach when available heuristics are
exhausted.

##INPUT
One or more puzzles formatted according to PUZZLE FORMAT are read from stdin.

##PUZZLE FORMAT
Puzzles are formatted as 9 lines of 9 characters each or as a single line of 81 characters (lengths exclude the line ending in both cases). Positive numbers are used for clues; a period (.) or zero (0) is used to indicate a missing clue.

Blank lines or lines beginning with a leading comment indicator ('#') are ignored.

For example, examples/puzzle.txt:

```
....4.7..
.....1.5.
84...2..3
1..5...3.
6.9..7...
5..1...2.
78...5..1
.....6.4.
....3.2..
```

Other examples may be found in the examples/ subdirectory.

##OUTPUT
If the solver can solve the puzzle, it outputs the solution on stdout. Otherwise, it outputs a partial solution on stdout.

##OUTPUT FORMAT
The default output format is a 9x9 grid with (.) to indicate a missing clue.
The --format option can be used to select an alternative output format. The
following options are available: 9., 90, 1., 10 where the first character indicates
the number of lines per solution and the second character indicates which
character is used to indicate a missing clue.

##DIAGNOSTICS
To view the reasoning of the solver, invoke sudoku with ```--verbose```.

##EXIT CODE
If the solver solves the last input puzzle read from stdin, it exits with a status of 0. Otherwise, it exits with a status of 1. If the last puzzle read from stdin is formatted incorrectly, sudoku exits with a non-zero exit code > 1.

##HEURISTICS
The solver currently implements the following heuristics.

##Direct Exclusion
When a value is asserted in a cell, the value is rejected in all other cells of the cell's 3 intersecting groups.

##Naked Single
When it known that the only possible value in a cell is a particular value, then that value is asserted for the cell.

##Hidden Single
When there is only one possible remaining cell for a given value in a given group, then that value is asserted in that cell.

##Naked Pair
When a group contains two cells whose values are known to be restricted to a pair of values, then any other cell in the same group cannot hold either of the two values, so we reject such values in those cells.

##Naked Triple
When a group contains three cells whose values are known to be restricted to a triple of values, then any other cell in the same group cannot hold any of the three values, so we reject such values in those cells.

##Exclude Complement
If a block contains 2 or 3 unsolved cells in a single row (or column) and those
cells are the only cells in the block that can contain a particular value, then that value can be rejected from the same row (or column) in other blocks.

This heuristic is known in other places as Pointed Pairs/Triples or Block/Line Reduction, depending on the context.

##Speculative Assertion
When we run out of other heuristics to try, we clone the current state of the
solution and speculatively assert one of the possible cell/value pairs and see
what happens.

##Contradiction Found
If a speculative assertion produced a contradiction, then we reject the cell/value
pair that was the subject of the speculative assertion in the original solution.

##Verify Uniqueness
If a speculative assertion finds a solution, we need to verify that the solution
is the only solution. We do this by rejecting the speculatively asserted cell/value
pair in a new clone of the puzzle taken prior to the speculative fork. If this
does not produce a contradiction, then the speculatively determined solution
is not unique and therefore the original puzzle does not have a unique completion.

#BUILDING
Install the golang tool chain for your host, then run:

```go install```

$GOPATH/bin/sudoku will contain the compiled binary.

#TERMINOLOGY
##Cell
A single cell
##Row
A horizontal group of 9 cells. Rows are numbered 1-9 from top to bottom.
##Column
A vertical group of 3 cells. Columns are numbered 1-9 from left to right.
##Block
A group of 9 cells arranged in a 3x3 grid, aligned on boundaries that are multiples of 3 + 1. Blocks are numbered 1-9 from top-left to bottom-right.
##Group
A group is a collection of 9 cells organized as a either a row, column or a block.
##Intersecting Group
Each cell intersects with 3 groups - the so-called 'intersecting groups' of the cell. Each cell has one intersecting group of each type: row, column and block.

#REVISION HISTORY
##1.2 - 10th October, 2015
* allow parser to accept puzzles using Royle's format.
* fixed an error in backtracker which caused some contradictions to be missed
* updated to use the same terminology as sudokuwiki and other places
* try to find the most constrained guess during backtracking
* refine documentation of PUZZLE FORMAT and INPUT
* factored out stream io into its own package
* add support for a --format option to select the output puzzle format

##1.1 - 9th October, 2015
* reorganized source code of model package
* add support for clue counting
* improved handling of bad inputs
* added support for queuing heuristics at different priorities
* added additional examples
