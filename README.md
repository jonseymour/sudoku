#NAME
sudoku - a golang sudoku solver

#SYNOPSIS
./sudoku [--verbose]|[--version] < puzzle > solution

#DESCRIPTION
'sudoku' implements a command-line Sudoku solver.

##INPUT
Puzzles formatted according to PUZZLE FORMAT are read from stdin.

##PUZZLE FORMAT
Puzzles are formatted as 9 lines of 9 characters each (excluding the line ending).
Numbers are used for clues. Period is used to indicate an absent clue.

For example, examples/puzzle.txt:

```
....4.7..
.....1.5.
84...2..3
1..5...3.
6.9..7...
5..1...2.
78...5..1
.....6.4.
....3.2..
```

Other examples may be found in the examples/ subdirectory.

##OUTPUT
If the solver can solve the puzzle, it outputs the solution on stdout. Otherwise, it outputs a partial solution on stdout.

##DIAGNOSTICS
To view the reasoning of the solver, invoke sudoku with ```--verbose```.

##EXIT CODE
If the solver solves the last input puzzle read from stdin, it exits with a status of 0. Otherwise, it exits with a status of 1. If the last puzzle read from stdin is formatted incorrectly, sudoku exits with a non-zero exit code > 1.

##HEURISTICS
The solver currently implements the following heuristics.

##exclude asserted value from other cells same group
When a value is asserted in a cell, the value is rejected in all other cells of the cell's 3 intersecting groups.

##only value in cell
When it known that the only possible value in a cell is a particular value, then that value is asserted for the cell.

##single remaining position in group for value
When there is only one possible remaining cell for a given value in a given group, then that value is asserted in that cell.

##pair exclusion
When a group contains two cells whose values are known to be restricted to a pair of values, then any other cell in the same group cannot hold either of the two values, so we reject such values in those cells.

#BUILDING
Install the golang tool chain for your host, then run:

```go install```

$GOPATH/bin/sudoku will contain the compiled binary.

#LIMITATIONS
The solver is currently incomplete; there are some puzzles - such as examples/toohard.txt - that cannot be solved using the currently implemented heuristics.

#TERMINOLOGY
##Cell
A single cell
##Row
A horizontal group of 9 cells. Rows are numbered 1-9 from top to bottom.
##Column
A vertical group of 3 cells. Columns are numbered 1-9 from left to right.
##Block
A group of 9 cells arranged in a 3x3 grid, aligned on boundaries that are multiples of 3 + 1. Blocks are numbered 1-9 from top-left to bottom-right.
##Group
A group is a collection of 9 cells organized as a either a row, column or a block.
##Intersecting Group
Each cell intersects with 3 groups - the so-called 'intersecting groups' of the cell. Each cell has one intersecting group of each type: row, column and block.
